// A lease renews when a request is admitted, and the daemon protects a lease while admitted work runs
// on it (#2509, ADR 0007). An artifact upload is the mirror image: it runs on the caller's side,
// before the install that consumes it is admitted, so nothing renews the lease while it runs and a
// large enough artifact expired the lease that was paying for the device it was being uploaded to
// (#2946). This module owns the answer — a beat with a budget that ends before the window does — and
// knows nothing about transports beyond the `send` it is handed.

/**
 * The fastest cadence a phase beats at, and the budget each beat gets until the window is known.
 *
 * Before the first beat answers, the window is unknown and the worst legal case is the registry's
 * five-second minimum: a beat that stalls must be abandoned and retried inside that window, or the
 * thing the beat exists to prevent happens while it waits. One second is a fifth of that minimum,
 * and no window-derived cadence is ever allowed below it, so it is also the loop's floor: a
 * misreported or pathologically short window cannot turn the beat into a request loop faster than
 * this.

/**
 * Runs one client-side phase under a lease it does not own the clock of.
 *
 * A lease renews when a request is admitted, and the daemon protects a lease while ADMITTED work
 * runs on it (#2509, ADR 0007). An artifact upload is the mirror image: it happens on the caller's
 * side, before the install request that will consume it is admitted, so nothing renews the lease
 * while it runs and a large enough artifact expired the lease that was paying for the device it was
 * being uploaded to (#2946).
 *
 * `heartbeat` is the caller's transport decision; `undefined` means there is no lease to protect and
 * the phase runs untouched. The first beat is fired immediately rather than one interval in, so a
 * lease shorter than that interval is renewed before it can lapse. A lease already gone is caught
 * early rather than at the end of the phase, though not before the phase begins: hashing, preflight,
 * and the first bytes can all happen while the opening beat is still outstanding. Each beat answers
 * with the window it just renewed, and the cadence becomes a third of that window.
 *
 * A beat's budget is the cadence it started on, and its successor is armed when the beat starts
 * rather than when it settles. A beat that never returns — a half-open connection, a daemon wedged
 * before it admits anything — is therefore abandoned on schedule instead of holding the schedule:
 * the lease is still beaten at window/3, and the abandoned round trip is cut off by its own budget
 * in the transport rather than by the command's 90-second heartbeat policy. An abandoned beat is
 * still listened to, because the answer it eventually gives can be a lost lease.
 *
 * A beat that fails for a reason that says nothing about this lease is reported and survived — one
 * lost request must not fail an upload that a later beat will cover. A beat that finds the lease
 * gone, or finds this client can never renew it, ends the phase with that error and aborts the
 * signal the phase runs under: the device is no longer ours (or was never reachable through this
 * request), and the only honest outcome is to say so before the bytes finish.
